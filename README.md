**Color-Sync** is a high-uptime, automated deployment pipeline designed to demonstrate seamless synchronization between source code and live infrastructure. This project serves as a foundational **Proof of Concept (PoC)** for a localized DevOps lifecycle, bridging the gap between a GitHub repository and a private Ubuntu environment.

## 🏗 Architecture & Logic



This project implements a **Push-to-Deploy** strategy:

1.  **Source Control:** Developer pushes changes to the `main` branch.
2.  **Job Assignment:** GitHub Actions detects the push and assigns the job to the **Self-Hosted Runner** on the local node.
3.  **Docker Orchestration:** * The runner pulls the latest source code.
    * Existing containers are forcefully removed (`docker rm -f`) to prevent port 8080 conflicts.
    * A fresh image is built to ensure environment parity.
    * The container is deployed with a `3000 -> 8080` port mapping.
4.  **Health Check:** The pipeline performs a post-deployment validation to ensure the service status is `Up`.

## ⚡ Key DevOps Features

* **Self-Hosted Infrastructure:** Optimized for cost-efficiency by leveraging local compute resources.
* **Automated Lifecycle:** Scripted cleanup of legacy images and containers to maintain 80GB storage health.
* **Modular UI:** A high-fidelity dashboard displaying real-time system status and build metadata.
* **CI/CD Maturity:** Achieved **Zero-Manual-Intervention** deployment from Git Push to Live URL.
